### Coding Standards

#### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use Ruff for linting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate

#### Code Organization
- **src/jms_to_clash.py**: Pure conversion logic only
- **test_jms_to_clash.py**: All tests using pytest
- **Makefile**: All build automation
- **dev.py**: Development helper commands

#### Function Guidelines
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use descriptive names
- Add docstrings for all public functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Return None for invalid input rather than raising exceptions

#### Testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both valid and invalid inputs
- Aim for high test coverage
- Group related tests in classes

### Adding New Proxy Protocols

To add support for a new proxy protocol:

1. **Add decoder function**:
   ```python
   def decode_new_protocol(url: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
       """Decode new protocol URL to proxy config"""
       try:
           # Parse URL and extract configuration
           # Return standardized proxy config dictionary
           return {
               'name': 'Server Name',
               'type': 'new_protocol',
               'server': 'hostname',
               'port': 12345,
               # ... other protocol-specific fields
           }
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error decoding new protocol: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
           return None
   ```

2. **Update parse_subscription function**:
   ```python
   elif line.startswith('new_protocol://'):
       proxy = decode_new_protocol(line)
   ```

3. **Add comprehensive tests**:
   ```python
   def test_decode_new_protocol(self):
       """Test new protocol URL decoding"""
       url = "new_protocol://config_here"
       result = decode_new_protocol(url)
       
       assert result is not None
       assert result['type'] == 'new_protocol'
       # ... more assertions
   ```

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Add to README.md supported formats
   - Update examples
   - Add to CHANGELOG.md
